The [COMHIS consortium][comhis-consortium] identifies overlooked moments of transformation in public discourse in Finland 1640â€“1910 by blending historical and computational approaches. The research will reflect on how social change and public discourse are intertwined, and how cultural, institutional, legal and technological changes are reflected both in publication metadata and the textual content of the publications. Particular attention is paid on transparent and reproducible data analysis approaches, published as an [open data analytical ecosystem][ropengiv-fennica]. The newspaper materials digitised by the National Library of Finland up until 1910 are freely available through the [digi.kansalliskirjasto.fi][kansalliskirjasto-digi] service.

The consortium members include Finnish national library (Centre for Preservation and Digitisation), University of Helsinki (Faculty of Humanities) and University of Turku (Departments of Cultural History and Information Technology).
