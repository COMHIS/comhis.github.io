The COMHIS Collective is a group of historians, computer scientists, linguists and digital humanities researchers brought together by shared research interest and interactions at the University of Helsinki.

Current research effort is centered around similarly named [COMHIS consortium][comhis-consortium] with a focus on identifying overlooked moments of transformation in public discourse in Europe between 17th and 19th century by blending historical and computational approaches. The research will reflect on how social change and public discourse are intertwined, and how cultural, institutional, legal and technological changes are reflected both in publication metadata and the textual content of the publications.

Particular attention is paid on transparent and reproducible data analysis approaches, published as open data analytical ecosystems. The goals of our work vary from project to project, but creating methodological approaches with wider applications are at the core of our aims.

The consortium members include people from Finnish national library, University of Helsinki (Faculty of Humanities) and Aalto University.
