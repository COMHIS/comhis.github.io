COMHIS Collective will organise a demo-session on “Analysing eighteenth-century key-terms and phrases using ECCO and ESTC” at the British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies [annual conference][BSECS17] at Oxford (4-6 January 2017).

Our slot is on Friday, 6th January at 11:00-12.30 (in the “Session Two”, Number 88). All welcome!

What we plan to do in this session is to introduce our workflows to explore [Eighteenth Century-Collections Online][ECCO] (ECCO) and [English Short-Title Catalogue][ESTC] (ESTC). In the future, our workflows will be made available as publicly usable tools. However, we want to give you an early, hands-on sneak peek at what we’re doing even before things coalesce to that point [read below to get at least a vague understanding of what is possible]. The idea of our text and data mining tools is that they serve different eighteenth-century scholars and historians in particular. Thus, the opportunity to organise this session and to get the BSECS people to test these tools and to comment on their use is very welcome to us.

**In order for us to plan our  session so that we can interact with the audience as much as possible, we would like you to propose certain general subjects (e.g. “politeness”, “justice” …) or more focused topics (e.g. “political economy”, “modern honour”… ) or particular key-terms (e.g. “petticoat”, “periwig”…) by tweeting them with hashtags #bsecs17 #comhis before 20.12.2016.

So, if your suggestion for a topic to be explored in our session is “human nature”, your tweet would read: human nature #bsecs17 #comhis …**

We welcome as many suggestions as you would like to make (no limits per tweeter). There are few technical parameters that need to be taken into consideration when deciding what topics and key-terms function best for demonstration purposes. Most importantly, the queries need to be large enough and distinguishable to function in “big data approach”. For example, “petticoat” is ok, but “condom” not so much. However, you need not to worry about these parameters of your suggestion. There are plenty of otherwise good key-terms and subjects that for technical or semantic reasons cannot be used in this type of analysis. We would like to demonstrate this as well. So, the more suggestions we have by 20th of December 2016 the better (of course, we have a long list of things that interest us as well, but then you’ll end up listening to stuff related to Bernard Mandeville and David Hume…). So, if you tweet your suggestions for subjects or key-terms to be explored before 20th of December 2016 we will have enough time to prepare for the session.

There will also be time for a hands-on part in our session, so if you bring a laptop with you (and the wireless connection at the college works), you can also do some of your own exploration of your favorite topics, although we will not have time to run many of the more time consuming calculations and the more complex analysis will be done with suggestions taken from twitter.
